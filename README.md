# arranging car agencies a project using different data structures
this is my midterm data structures course project.


in this project I have manually implemented a generalized LinkedList ( not using the Java Libraries ) to store the Orders and the Car agencies.
also Max-Heapify algorithm has been implemented to manage the priority of the Orders depending on when they have been given to the input.

the persian project introduction has been attached

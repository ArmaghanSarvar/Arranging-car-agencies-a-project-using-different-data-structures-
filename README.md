# arranging car agencies a project using different data structures
this is my midterm data structure project.


in this project I have manually implemented a LinkedList ( not using the Java Libraries ) to storing the Orders and the Car agencies.
also Max-Heapify algorithm has been implemented to manage the priority of the Orders depending on when they have been given to the input.
